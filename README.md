# How to play

There is a simple BASH script that you can use to actually play the game.

The script is called *peek*

*peek* can be run by passing it a simply file, the file that you wish to look at for 15 seconds and then after covering your screen the file that you wish to work on.

In the case of this repository that would be ```index.js```

To start the game use this command:

```bash
./peek index.js
```

The peek script will instruct you through the process, simply read the prompts provided and press ENTER when told to, also dont forget to look at the code when it shows it to you, you will be warned before you are shown any code so that you can prepare yourself!

Then after the peek script has shown you the code you will again be prompted to cover your screen and then press ENTER again to get access back to VIM with the specified file open.

Edit the code (without looking ofcourse) then save and run the tests!

Good Luck!
