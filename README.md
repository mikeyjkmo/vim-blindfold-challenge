# How to play

There is a simple BASH script that you can use to actually play the game.

The script is called *peak*

*peak* can be run by passing it a simply file, the file that you wish to look at for 15 seconds and then after covering your screen the file that you wish to work on.

In the case of this repository that would be ```index.js```

Save and run the tests without looking!
