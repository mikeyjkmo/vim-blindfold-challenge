# How to play

Look at index.js for 15 seconds. You may look at the tests for longer.

You can use this command to open the file and then automatically close it after X seconds:

```bash
> timeout 15 vim index.js
```

Then:

```bash
> vim index.js -w keystrokes.txt
```

Save and run the tests without looking!
